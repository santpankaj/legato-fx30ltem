The following issues have been patched in 18.\+06.\+1\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A bug is fixed that caused a data corruption issue when performing a system update. If the update created a secure storage entry that was more then 4k in size the bug caused the last byte to be silently dropped.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_Features}{}\section{New Features}\label{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_Features}
The following are the list of new features that have been added into the 18.\+06 Release\+:\hypertarget{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_Features_SAR}{}\subsection{Modem Radio Control A\+PI}\label{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_Features_SAR}
\hyperlink{c_mrc_le_mrc_sar}{S\+AR (Specific Absorption Rate)} is a measure of RF energy absorption by the human body. Users can dynamically select a pre-\/configured S\+AR backoff state in the modem so they can adjust the S\+AR depending on their needs.

The following functions have been added to the Modem Radio Control A\+PI\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{le__mrc__interface_8h_adc99580fe5d419451e452cfcc805509d}{le\+\_\+mrc\+\_\+\+Set\+Sar\+Backoff\+State()} to set a new S\+AR backoff state.
\item \hyperlink{le__mrc__interface_8h_a8543cc2e58f0ddfcccca0942afda743a}{le\+\_\+mrc\+\_\+\+Get\+Sar\+Backoff\+State()} to get the current S\+AR backoff state.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_Features_eCall}{}\subsection{e\+Call A\+PI}\label{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_Features_eCall}
In test mode developers are able to retrieve and set the interval where the I\+VS remains registered in the network after the completion of the transmission of the test results to the System Operator. The default time value is set to 120 seconds.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{le__ecall__interface_8h_aaaba61357cfe615e90246c16f710a804}{le\+\_\+ecall\+\_\+\+Get\+Era\+Glonass\+Post\+Test\+Registration\+Time()}

\end{DoxyItemize}

The Psap Number functions now return values for L\+E\+\_\+\+U\+N\+S\+U\+P\+P\+O\+R\+T\+ED and L\+E\+\_\+\+O\+V\+E\+R\+F\+L\+OW
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{le__ecall__interface_8h_a959c53f03bb85f1071fcf7cb58e3067e}{le\+\_\+ecall\+\_\+\+Get\+Psap\+Number()} Add return values for L\+E\+\_\+\+U\+N\+S\+U\+P\+P\+O\+R\+T\+ED and L\+E\+\_\+\+O\+V\+E\+R\+F\+L\+OW

\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_Features_gnss}{}\subsection{G\+N\+S\+S A\+PI}\label{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_Features_gnss}
A new function \hyperlink{le__gnss__interface_8h_af32fd94e35e4df94b65c84740c5dbf42}{le\+\_\+gnss\+\_\+\+Convert\+Data\+Coordinate\+System()} can be called to convert a location data value from a coordinate system to another. Currently it is possible to convert the following data types\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Latitude
\item Longitude
\item Altitude
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_BFeatures}{}\section{Beta Features}\label{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_BFeatures}
The following features have been added to the 18.\+06 Release and are feature complete but are still in a testing phase. Please provide feedback for these features on our \href{https://forum.legato.io/}{\tt forums}.\hypertarget{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_BFeatures_KernelModules}{}\subsection{Kernel Modules}\label{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_BFeatures_KernelModules}
\hyperlink{conceptsKernelModule}{Kernel Modules} functionality has been added to support dependencies between kernel modules and dependencies between kernel modules and apps/components. We have also included functionality into the kernel module feature to \hyperlink{defFilesMdef_defFilesMdef_bundles}{bundle} other files with the kernel module sources and provide \hyperlink{defFilesMdef_defFilesMdef_scripts}{scripts} to load and unload the kernel module from your target.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Before building kernel modules into your Legato System you may have to perform some extra \hyperlink{basicBuildToolchain_basicBuildLegato_ToolchainSWI_KO}{toolchain setup steps}.

\hypertarget{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_Constraints}{}\subsection{Constraints and Limitations}\label{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_Constraints}
\hypertarget{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_ConstraintsLinuxSupport}{}\subsubsection{Dev Machine Linux Version}\label{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_ConstraintsLinuxSupport}
To develop applications within the Legato Application Framework, a current supported \href{https://www.ubuntu.com/info/release-end-of-life}{\tt Long Term Support version of Ubuntu Linux} is required on your dev machine (or running in a virtual box on Windows). Ubuntu 16.\+04 is the current {\bfseries recommended} version to use on your dev machine.\hypertarget{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_ConstECMUSB}{}\subsubsection{E\+C\+M-\/\+U\+S\+B modem manager issue}\label{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_ConstECMUSB}
Ubuntu 15.\+10 and newer has Modem Manager version {\ttfamily 1.\+4.\+12-\/1ubuntu1} installed by default which conflicts with the E\+C\+M-\/\+U\+SB driver when connecting a target. Modem manager may cause the Ubuntu Network Manager to crash on your host and/or your target device to become unavailable over U\+SB.

{\bfseries Symptoms\+:} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Network\+Manager crashing when plugging into your device over U\+SB, or
\item The target device becomes inaccessible after 30 seconds.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries Recommended} {\bfseries Work} {\bfseries Around\+:} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Uninstall {\ttfamily modemmanager} from Ubuntu or
\item \href{http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/modemmanager}{\tt Downgrade {\ttfamily modemmanager} to version 1.\+0.\+0-\/2ubuntu1}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_ConstraintsTC}{}\subsubsection{Sierra Wireless Toolchain Install}\label{releaseNotes18060_rn1806_ConstraintsTC}
There is currently an error with setting up the W\+P76\+XX and W\+P77\+XX toolchain and the toolchain only partially installs. The part of the script to install and setup the kernel headers does not run and produces the following errors\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}scripts/kconfig/Makefile:36: recipe for target 'silentoldconfig' failed
make[2]: *** [silentoldconfig] Error 1
Makefile:546: recipe for target 'silentoldconfig' failed
make[1]: *** [silentoldconfig] Error 2
make: *** No rule to make target 'include/config/auto.conf', needed by 'scripts'.  Stop.
\end{DoxyVerb}


To resolve this remove the installed toolchain and reinstall with {\ttfamily sudo} privileges.

Example of setting up the toolchain for a 64bit dev machine and a W\+P76 module with product release 9\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ rm -rf /opt/swi/y22-ext
$ sudo poky-swi-ext-glibc-x86_64-meta-toolchain-swi-ext-armv7a-neon-toolchain-swi-ext-2.2.3.sh
\end{DoxyVerb}
