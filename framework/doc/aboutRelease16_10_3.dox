@subsection rn16_10_3_devModeGDB devMode and GDB

Further improvements have been made to the Developer Mode core app:
- @c devMode is no longer installed by default on the target.  To run @c devMode you must build
  Legato AF 16.10.3 for your target device, then install @c devMode with @c app @c install.
- GDB server is now bundled with @c devMode to enable easy removal for production deployments.

More information on @ref basicTargetDevMode "how to install @c devMode"
and @ref howToDebugGDB "GDB debugging" info can be found in on [legato.io](https://legato.io).

@note To install @c devMode using
[Developer Studio](https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/airprime/software/developer-studio-installinstructions)
, refer to Developer Studio's internal documentation.

@subsection rn16_10_3_binaryapps Binary Only Applications Supported

The ability to @ref buildToolsmkapp "distribute binary only applications" without source code is now
supported.  @c mkapp will build a binary only app bundle that can then be included in an
@ref defFilesSdef without the source code.

@section rn16_10_3_removeJava Experimental Java Support

Thank you for the feedback given about the @b experimental Java Support in the Legato AF.  We are
working on officially supporting Java within the framework, but until further work can be done we
have removed Java Support from legato.io.

conflicts with the ECM-USB driver when connecting a target.  Modem manager may cause the Ubuntu
Network Manager to crash on your host and/or your target device to become unavailable over USB.

@b Symptoms:
-   NetworkManager crashing when plugging into your device over USB, or
-   The target device becomes inaccessible after 30 seconds.

@b Recommended  @b Work  @b Around:
-   Uninstall @c modemmanager from Ubuntu or
-   Downgrade @c modemmanager to version 1.0.0-2ubuntu1

[Download version 1.0.0-2ubuntu1 of modemmanager](http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/modemmanager)
