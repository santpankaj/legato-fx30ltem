@section mrc_SetSignalStrengthIndDelta Signal strength
On Qualcomm-based platform, the signal strength indication delta resolution set in
le_mrc_SetSignalStrengthIndDelta() API depends on the Radio Access Technology (RAT) used.

For TD-SCDMA RAT technology, the signal delta is set with steps of 1 dBm with a minimum of one dBm.
Intermediate values less than 1 dBm are rounded.
For the other RAT technologies, the signal delta is set with steps of 0.1 dBm with a minimum of 0.1
dBm.

For example, to set a signal strength indication delta of 10.6 dBm, the delta value must be set to
106. This value is rounded to 11 dBm for TD-SCDMA RAT technology. (105 would have been equivalent to
10dBm on TD-SCDMA).

Under TD-SCDMA RAT technology, a delta value less than 10 is forbiden.

@section APN_length APN Length
To set the Access Point Name (APN) for the given profile, le_mdc_SetAPN() API is used.

The maximum APN length is limited by the platform.<br>
