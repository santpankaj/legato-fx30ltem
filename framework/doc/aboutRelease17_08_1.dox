@section rn1708_ReleaseNotes Legato Application Framework Release Process

Legato AF releases are not tied to any specific  product release.  Once we have released
Legato AF, processor vendors (like Sierra Wireless) will take the release and integrate it into their
own <b> product release. </b>

<b> Legato AF Release Schedule VS Processor Vendor Release Schedule </b>

@image html LegatoReleaseVSModuleVendorRelease.png

Example:
 - Legato AF Team posts release 17.07
 - Processor Vendor takes release 17.07 and builds an associated Linux Distro to create a "Legato
   Platform"
 - Processor Vendor tests and releases a "Legato Platform" with their Modem Firmware as "Product
   Release Y"
 - Legato AF Team posts release 17.08, 17.09 and 17.10 without the Processor Vendor packaging it into
   a Product Release.  Releases are able to installed with the vendor's Product Release Y,
   but <b> may not be officially supported by the Processor Vendor. </b>
 - Processor Vendor takes release 17.11 and creates a "Legato Platform" and "Product Release Z",
   and so on..

<b>For any questions about the Product Releases please contact your Processor Vendor.

@subsection rn1708_Constraints Constraints and Limitations

@subsubsection rn1708_ContraintsLinuxSupport Dev Machine Linux Version

To develop applications within the Legato AF, a
[Long Term Support version of Ubuntu Linux](https://www.ubuntu.com/info/release-end-of-life) is
needed on your dev machine (or running in a virtual box on Windows).  Any release older then Ubuntu
12.04 is no longer supported by the Legato AF.

@subsubsection rn1708_ConstECMUSB ECM-USB modem manager issue

Ubuntu 15.10 and newer is default installed with Modem Manager version @c 1.4.12-1ubuntu1 which
conflicts with the ECM-USB driver when connecting a target.  Modem manager may cause the Ubuntu
Network Manager to crash on your host and/or your target device to become unavailable over USB.

@b Symptoms:
- NetworkManager crashing when plugging into your device over USB, or
- The target device becomes inaccessible after 30 seconds.

@b Recommended  @b Work  @b Around:
- Uninstall @c modemmanager from Ubuntu or
- Downgrade @c modemmanager to version 1.0.0-2ubuntu1
[Download version 1.0.0-2ubuntu1 of modemmanager](http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/modemmanager)
