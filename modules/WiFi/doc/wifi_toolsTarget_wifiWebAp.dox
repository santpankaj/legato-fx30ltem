/** @page wifi_wifiwebAp_sample WiFi Access Point Web Sample App

This sample provides a webpage to configure the WiFi Access Point.

This sample app may be included in the default legato build on your target but it is not started by
default; it needs to be started manually.

Starting the application will start the webserver on port 8080. <br>
Go to the IP of your module NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN:8080. <br>
The default address of your module should be 192.168.2.2:8080. <br>
The port number of the webserver is set in the application. <br>

@warning  Only use a SIM card without PIN code.

5. Open a web browser with the IP of your module http://NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN:8080
6. Set the desired parameters on the webpage and click the "Start WiFi AP" button.
7. Wait while result page is generated (this will take 15-20 seconds).
8. You can monitor the progression of the connection by looking at the logs.
